1. Personas in Text Data :

   | Code | Full Form            | Meaning                                         |
   | ---- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
   | P-P  | Person to Person     | One individual communicating with another       |
   | P-B  | Person to Business   | A customer or user giving feedback to a company |
   | B-P  | Business to Person   | A company sending messages to individuals       |
   | B-B  | Business to Business | One company communicating with another          |

     1. person-person(P-P) : Individual communicating directly with another individual.

     Examples:

     WhatsApp or Telegram messages.

     Private chats in social media.

     Email from friend to friend.

     SMS between two people.

     2. P-B(Person -Business) : A person providing feedback, complaints, or queries to a company.

     Examples:
     
     Product reviews on Amazon.

     Complaints or queries in customer support.

     Feedback in surveys or feedback forms.

     3. B-P(Business - Person) : A business sending communication to a customer or general public.

     Examples:

     Promotional emails or SMS.

     App notifications like “Get 50% off today!”.

     Survey invitations.

     Service alerts (e.g., "Your order has shipped").

     4. B-B(Business - Business) : Communication between two businesses or internal business teams.

     Examples:

     Formal emails between companies.

     Business Requirement Documents (BRDs).

     Project reports or Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

     Vendor-client communication.

2. Importance of personas :

   1. Helps Identify the Nature of Communication.

      Personas help us understand who is talking to whom — whether it’s casual (P-P), complaint-driven (P-B), marketing (B-P), or
      
      formal (B-B). This gives context to the text.

   2. Influences Preprocessing Techniques.

      A P-P (Person-to-Person) message may contain emojis, slang, or abbreviations that require different preprocessing compared to
    
      B-B (Business-to-Business) communication, which uses formal, structured language.

   3. Guides Model Selection and Analysis Goals.

      If the persona is P-B, we may apply sentiment analysis to understand customer satisfaction.

      If it’s B-B, we might apply entity recognition or contract mining for compliance.

   4. Improves Business Decisions.

      Knowing the persona helps businesses respond better — e.g., understanding customer pain points in P-B, or optimizing
      
      promotional messages in B-P based on response patterns.

   5. Supports Personalization and Targeting.

      In B-P (Business to Person) messages, businesses can analyze how different groups react and personalize their content to 
      
      improve customer engagement and conversion rates.

   6. Enables Text Segmentation and Filtering.

      We can filter and group text data based on personas before applying models. For example, treat chat messages differently 
      
      from formal documents for accurate analysis.

   7. Increases Accuracy of NLP Models.

      Training separate models for different personas improves accuracy. A model trained on formal emails (B-B) may not work well 
      
      on tweets (P-P) unless we consider the persona.

   8. Essential in Real-World Applications.

      In customer support, separating P-B tickets from internal B-B communications allows better ticket routing, faster 
      
      responses, and improved automation.

    Summary :

   “Personas tell us the context of the text, which helps us decide how to clean it, what models to use, and what insights to
   
   extract. It’s like knowing the speaker and the audience before interpreting what’s being said.”

Example : Online Food Ordering Process :

 Scenario:

 You visit a food ordering website or app (like Zomato or Swiggy) and:

 Select 2 items

 Add to cart

 Click "Pay Now"

 Redirected to payment site (e.g., Razorpay, Paytm)

 Complete payment

 Redirected back to order confirmation page

 * What is happening behind the scenes ? 

 | Step | User Action         | Backend Process (Tech + API)                        |
 | ---- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
 | 1    | Select items        | App shows menu from database using **API**          |
 | 2    | Add to cart         | Cart info saved temporarily (local or backend DB)   |
 | 3    | Click Pay           | App **calls payment API** to create payment request |
 | 4    | Redirect to payment | App sends you to a **third-party payment gateway**  |
 | 5    | Complete payment    | Payment gateway confirms transaction using API      |
 | 6    | Redirect back       | App receives payment status via **callback API**    |
 | 7    | Show confirmation   | Order is saved; confirmation message is shown       |

* Personas involved in this scenario : 

| Code    | Who is Talking to Whom               | Example Text / Data                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **P-B** | You → Restaurant system (user order) | “I want 2 pizzas”                             |
| **B-P** | Restaurant → You (confirmation)      | “Your order #123 has been placed!”            |
| **B-B** | Restaurant App → Payment Gateway     | “Send payment request of ₹500 for order #123” |
| **B-B** | Payment Gateway → Restaurant App     | “Payment success/failure for order #123”      |
