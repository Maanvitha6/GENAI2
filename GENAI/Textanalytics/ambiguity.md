1. Ambiguity :

   | Feature        | Explanation                                                                                            |
   | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Definition** | Ambiguity occurs when a word, phrase, or sentence has **more than one meaning**.                       |
   | **Types**      | Lexical (word-level), syntactic (sentence structure), semantic (meaning-based)                         |
   | **Example**    | *“I saw her duck.”* → Did she bend down? Or did she have a bird?                                       |
   | **Importance** | Context helps resolve the correct meaning. Without it, **sentiment analysis can fail or misclassify**. |

2. word-word relation :

   | Feature            | Explanation                                                                                            |
   | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Definition**     | The relationship between two words — including synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms.                |
   | **Examples**       | `good` and `nice` (synonyms), `happy` and `sad` (antonyms)                                             |
   | **Use in NLP**     | Helps improve **semantic understanding**, word embeddings, and context in models like Word2Vec or BERT |
   | **Why it matters** | Sentiment and intent often depend on **word associations** and co-occurrence patterns                  |

3. punctuation :

   | Feature               | Explanation                                                                                     |
   | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Definition**        | Symbols like `.`, `?`, `!`, `...` that define structure and **emotion** in language             |
   | **Importance in NLP** | Influences **polarity, sarcasm, emphasis, and sentence tone**                                   |
   | **Example**           | "Great." (neutral/sarcastic) vs "Great!" (positive)                                             |
   | **Impact**            | Removing punctuation without context-aware logic may lead to **misclassification in sentiment** |

4. Polarity :
   
   | **Aspect**       | **Details**                                                        |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Definition**   | Measures how positive or negative a statement is (range: -1 to +1) |
   | **Example**      | "I love this!" → +0.9<br>"I hate this." → -0.8                     |
   | **Use**          | Assigns a sentiment score to words/sentences                       |
   | **Context Role** | *"Not bad"* → often positive despite the word *bad*                |

5. Named Entity Recognition (NER) :

   | **Aspect**       | **Details**                                                                 |
   | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Definition**   | Identifies real-world entities like names, places, organizations, dates     |
   | **Example**      | *“Apple Inc. launched in California.”* → Apple Inc. = ORG, California = GPE |
   | **Importance**   | Extracts useful info for summaries, knowledge graphs, recommendations       |
   | **Context Role** | *“Apple”* → company or fruit? NER disambiguates using context               |

6.  Homograph vs Homophone vs Homonym :

    | **Aspect**        | **Homograph**                     | **Homophone**                   | **Homonym**                               |
    | ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | **Definition**    | Same spelling, different meanings | Same sound, different spellings | Same spelling & sound, different meanings |
    | **Spelling**      | Same                              | Different                       |  Same                                      |
    | **Pronunciation** | May differ                        | Same                            | Same                                      |
    | **Example**       | *lead* (metal) vs *lead* (guide)  | *write* vs *right*              | *bat* (animal) vs *bat* (cricket)         |
    | **NLP Issue**     | Needs POS/context disambiguation  | Challenges in speech-to-text    | Requires full context to resolve          |

7. Real-world Business Use Cases :
 
   | Concept        | Use Case Example                                                                        |
   | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Ambiguity      | Chatbots misinterpreting queries like “Can you book a flight?” (as question vs command) |
   | Word relations | Auto-suggestion: *“cheap”* → suggest *“affordable”*, *“budget”*                         |
   | Punctuation    | Sentiment analysis for *social media* with exclamations/emojis                          |

   | NER            | Extract *company names* from news articles for stock prediction                         |
   | Homophones     | Voice assistants need to resolve *"there" vs "their"*                                   |
   | Homographs     | Disambiguating *“close”* (shut) vs *“close”* (nearby) in a search query                 |

8. Using NLP Concepts for Sentiment Analysis in Business :

   By using key NLP concepts like ambiguity resolution, word-word relations, punctuation handling, polarity scoring, homonyms/
   
   homophones/homographs, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) — we can accurately perform sentiment analysis.

   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Ambiguity       | Helps avoid misinterpreting words with multiple meanings    |
   | Word relations  | Understand synonyms, antonyms for better polarity detection |
   | Punctuation     | Distinguish sarcasm and emotional emphasis                  |
   | Polarity        | Score comments to rank positivity or negativity             |
   | NER             | Focus on people, brands, places being discussed             |
   | Homophones etc. | Resolve confusion in voice/text inputs                      |

* By combining these NLP techniques, businesses can turn raw text into actionable insight, improving decision-making and customer
